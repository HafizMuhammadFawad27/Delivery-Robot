
A web-based robot control and monitoring system that enables users to control a delivery robot, monitor its status, and manage its operations through a unified interface.

Core Features:

Real-time robot control interface with status monitoring
API endpoints for robot communication and data management
Frontend and backend integration for seamless operation
Robot mapping and sensor/actuator control system
Visual References:
Inspired by modern robotics control interfaces like Boston Dynamics' tablet interface and ROS (Robot Operating System) visualization tools, known for their professional and functional design.

Style Guide:

Colors: Primary #2196F3 (control blue), Secondary #4CAF50 (status green), Warning #FFC107 (alert yellow), Error #F44336 (error red), Background #F5F5F5 (light grey), Text #212121 (dark grey)
Design: Roboto/Source Code Pro fonts, grid-based dashboard layout with control panels, status indicators, and map visualization, 16px spacing, responsive design optimized for both desktop and tablet interfaces
Components: Control panel with robot status indicators, real-time map view, sensor data displays, and command interface
Note: The implementation will focus on creating a web application using Flask for the backend (as Django is not available on Replit) and vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS for the frontend (as React.js is preferred but can be complex for rapid prototyping on Replit).

I've enhanced the UI with better colors, animations, and visual feedback. The changes include:

Improved card designs with hover effects and shadows
Enhanced button interactions with smooth transitions
Added smooth animations to the robot map
Better contrast for sensor readings and status indicators
Let me verify if these visual improvements are working correctly.
